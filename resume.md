## Executive Summary

* 12+ years of commercial software engineering experiance in a variety of languages
* Track record of delivering under extremely demanding conditions
* Track record of building and leading strong engineering teams
* Proficient in python as my daily driver language, rust out of interest and previous C and C++ commercial experiance
* DevOps experaince in both the datacentre and cloud
* PhD in High Energy Physics from Imperial College London, gained for my research at the Large Hadron Collider


## Working Experience

#### Faculty (Various Roles Currently Principal Engineer, 2019 - present) 

* First client facing engineer
  * Grew the team to approx 30 engineers before the team was re-orgainsed to business unit reporting lines
  * Responsible for creating the engineering progression framework, and have grown several engineers from L1 to Lead
* Noteable projects:
  * NHS Covid response, I was seconded along with our CTO to NHS HQ during covid, faculty lead the data response to covid. Predicting disease trasmission at a national level. During this time I was responsible for:
    1. Designing the central data store for holding all covid information, and preserving patient privacy whilst enabling data analysis at a national scale
    2. Agent based modelling of disease trasmission, we worked with the oxford big data institute who were the team responsaible for suggesting the covid tracking app. They had generated an agent based model in C which was capable of simulating a few hundred thousand interactions, we scaled this to be able to simulate the entire country and ensure correct regional calibration in terms of the transmission rate and population categorisation as well as providing confidence limits in terms of the stocatistic nature of the agent based model and the initial conditions. This required creating a python interface for the C program, the ability to define experiements to run for a team of data scientists and creating a highly scalable (up to order 10k compute cores) cluster to perform these experiments in, in Azure.
    3. Leiasing with various govenment departments to collect relevant data, ensure data quality and data security.
    4. Sclaing out the users for the compute cluster to other long running experimental groups
    5. Scoping requirements of supporting systems
    6. Communicating results to senior stakeholders and preparing briefs to downing street

  * MOD StratCom
    * The nature of this work means that I can't go into much detail however during my with them I have:
    1. Deployed overseas to an operational thetre in support of ongoing counter terrorism operations
    2. Been responsabile for deploying applications to OFFICAL-SECRET classifcation systems
    3. Been responsable for generating application deployment processes to OFFICAL-SECRET systems
    4. Built along side analysists applications for data search and retrieval tailored to their specific needs
    5. Deployed ML to edge base systems in a varity of harsh envrionments
    6. Been responsbile for a team of military and civilan software engineers, and deligated senior responsable person for the employment of software capabilities including AI enabled systems.
    7. Been responsable for hardware and software integration
    8. Managing the client relationship between Faculty and MOD
    9. Mentoring MOD staff

* Non project related work:
  * Developed Faculty's engineering deployment principals
  * Developed Faculty's software sign off proccess for deployment into risky envrionments
  * Various business development and pitching contributing to securing millions of pounds worth of projects
  * Hiring, including at director level


#### Five.ai (DevOps Engineer, Sept 2018 - Apr 2019) 

* DevOps and systems engineering for self driving car research and development

#### Various short term contacts (July 2017 - Mar 2018)

* Various short term positions after COHEAT

#### CoHeat (Software Engineer, Dec 2015 - July 2017) 
* Second Technical hire
* Migrated monolithic software application to micro services based application, using rest, GRPC and KAFAK
* Some hardware engineering, including reverse engineering of power line and wirless serial heat and water flow meteres
* DevOps and testing pipeline creation, hardware maintainace
* Many other duties as it was an early stage startup

#### Velocix (Software Engineer Dec 2013 - Dec 2015) 
* Product design and research Evaluating high scale storage solutions, for cost efficiency, feature set and performance. Designed and implemented automated provisioning and roll out.
* Joint research with Intel on the CEPH storage platform.
Creating test plans and writing stories for the development of the project.


* Designing and running manual performance tests against the Velocix CDN and the Velocix Enhanced Video Origin.
* Writing automated performance tests.
* Debugging errors though the entire network chain, from end user to test hardware to the CDN appliances.
